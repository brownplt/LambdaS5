This document describes how to build S5 and reproduce the results from our DLS
2012 submission.  Any comments, problems, or questions should be emailed to
joe@cs.brown.edu.  This file is intended to accompany the tarball found at
http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/plt/dl/s5/index.html.  That tarball contains
source code from revision aef71e59a7f9bbc955450021b59fa2d8969f3fb2 of the
LambdaS5 repository (https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5), and a checkout of
revision a63149989665 of the Test262 repository
(http://hg.ecmascript.org/).

What we ran on (approximate system requirements):

- 32-bit Linux (we have a precompiled SpiderMonkey for you; see later for how
  to run on other systems)
- Ocaml 3.12 or higher (though nothing higher exists as this is written)
- Python 2.6 or higher (earlier might work, but you need good popen() support)
- sh, make, autoconf, etc.

To build S5, you need to build the ocamlgraph library and copy some files to
the right spot.  All the source is included in this tarball, but you need to
run the following:

1. cd src/ocamlgraph-1.8.1
2. autoconf && ./configure
3. make
4. cp graph.cmi graph.cma ../../lib/
5. cd ..
6. make

Before you can run anything, you need to make sure that bin/js is linked to an
appropriate executable for your OS.  The default is js-1.8.5-Linux-i686, which
should work on most 32-bit Linux systems, for other systems we're happy to
help, but might not know off the top of our heads how to get it set up for you.

Then, go into the tests/ directory, and the script s5 takes JavaScript files or
stdin and runs it through parsing, desugaring, and S5-interp:

> cd tests
> echo "console.log('s5 works');" | ./s5i
s5 works
undefined
>

To test that most things are working, without going through the longer process
of running all of the conformance suite, you can run our own set of unit tests
(this takes about 5 minutes for us, your system may vary):

> ./all_tests.sh 
189 tests passed
0 tests failed

Finally, to reproduce the results from the paper, this tarball is set up with
the checkout of test262 that we used in the hg-test262 directory.  If you'd
like to check them out separately, they are from revision a63149989665, found
at http://hg.ecmascript.org/tests/test262/. We ran them using the
test-section.sh script, one chapter at a time.  test-results.sh is a thin
wrapper around a call to the test262-provided harness/runner that points it to
the s5 script and specifies what kind of output we'd like.  Note that if you
check the test262 repository separately, you will need to change the path in
test-section.sh to point to your checkout.  To run a section with the defaults:

> cd tests/
> sh test-section.sh <section-name> > <outfile>

For example, to generate results for chapter 7:

> sh test-section.sh ch07 > ch07-nonstrict.txt

To run strict tests only, use:

> sh test-section.sh --strict ch07 > ch07-strict.txt

So, to reproduce the tables in the paper, you'd run test-section.sh for each
section, in both modes.  WARNING: Before you run, know that this takes several
minutes for most chapters.  For chapters 12 and 15 in non-strict mode, it takes
overnight, so be ready to get a cup of coffee or go to bed when you start
running.

> sh test-section.sh ch07 > ch07-nonstrict.txt
 ...
> sh test-section.sh ch15 > ch15-nonstrict.txt

> sh test-section.sh --strict ch07 > ch07-strict.txt
 ...
> sh test-section.sh --strict ch15 > ch15-strict.txt

In each outputted file, there is a "Summary" section that we used to pull
results for the paper.  You can also compare the files you output (using your
favorite diff program), with the paper-results directory we've included, which
has the full output for each file:

> diff ch07-strict.txt paper-results/ch07-strict.txt
>
